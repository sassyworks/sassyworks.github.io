{: .one}
> ### Brieff
>
> NativeScript is an open source framework with a vibrant community of developers contributing to the project in a variety of ways. Decluttering website layout, organising information and improve readability to guide users with ease through content was an essential goal for NativeScript team.
>

{: .one}
> ### Challenge
> Focus NativeScript users on the content and reduce unnecessary distractions as much as possible, while still not oversimplifying the interface. 

{: .one}
> ### Solution
>
> Simple, structured sections make content easy to digest. Multiple clear call-to-actions. Simple, straightforward typographic hierarchy. Discrete navigation which focuses users on the content. Alternating left and right-aligned features to keep users engaged.

> ### Color Palette


{: .one}

> To achieve the clean look and natural feel, I chose a cool color scheme with prevailing white and NativeScriptâ€™ signature blue color as dominant focal color for backgrounds, content elements and links.

> ### Typography

{: .one}

> To improve readability, I chose two legible typefaces, established a clear typographic hierarchy and started experimenting to find the perfect balance between the line height, letter spacing and text size. 
I had to make sure that the content has the perfect density that is both readable and scannable.
